## 🌎 General Info
This project was created as part of my university coursework to explore how small daily decisions add up to a measurable environmental impact.  

The program lets users input:
- Coffees per day  
- Kilometres driven  
- Meat meals per week  
- Fast fashion items purchased  
- Minutes spent showering  
- Milk type (cow, soy, oat, almond)

It then calculates estimated **water usage** and **CO₂ emissions**, showing users where they can make simple, sustainable swaps.

## ✨ Features
- Interactive Tkinter GUI built in Python  
- Multi-page layout for better user experience (navigation between “Input” and “Tips” pages)  
- Real-time calculation of environmental impact  
- Educational tips encouraging positive habits  
- Clear, friendly interface suitable for beginners

- **Python 3.12**
- **Tkinter** for GUI design
- **Custom dictionaries** for data storage (milk types, emissions, etc.)
- **Statistical data** from environmental reports (Statista, Swissmilk, MLA, etc.)
