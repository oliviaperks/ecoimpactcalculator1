## 🌎 General Info

The program lets users input:
- Coffees per day  
- Kilometres driven  
- Meat meals per week  
- Fast fashion items purchased  
- Minutes spent showering  
- Milk type (cow, soy, oat, almond)

It then calculates estimated **water usage** and **CO₂ emissions**, showing users where they can make simple, sustainable swaps.

## ✨ Features
- Interactive Tkinter GUI built in Python  
- Multi-page layout for better user experience (navigation between “Input” and “Tips” pages)  
- Real-time calculation of environmental impact  
- Educational tips encouraging positive habits  
- Clear, friendly interface suitable for beginners

## 💻 Technologies
Project built using:
- **Python 3.12**
- **Tkinter** for GUI design
- **Custom dictionaries** for data storage (milk types, emissions, etc.)
- **Statistical data** from environmental reports (Statista, Swissmilk, MLA, etc.)

---

## ⚙️ Setup
What you’ll need:

- Python 3 installed

-  VS Code Installed

 To run the project locally:

Clone this repository
git clone 

Move into project directory
cd ecoimpactcalculator

Run the app
python main.py

## How It Works

Input collection: Users fill in fields for coffee, driving, meat meals, etc.

Calculations:

Coffee water use = coffees × 130 L

Driving emissions = km × 0.21 kg CO₂

Shower water = minutes × 9 L

Milk type uses specific per-litre data from Statista (2023) and Swissmilk (Geburt et al., 2022).

Output: Results are displayed in a readable summary box.

Tips page: Offers simple advice for reducing impact without guilt or negativity.
