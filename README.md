# üåø Daily Habits Environmental Impact Calculator

A Python-based Tkinter app that estimates your daily environmental impact, including water use and CO‚ÇÇ emissions, based on everyday activities such as coffee consumption, driving, and showering. Designed to promote awareness through simple interaction and positive behaviour change.

## üåé General Info
This project was created as part of my university coursework to explore how small daily decisions add up to a measurable environmental impact.  

The program lets users input:
- Coffees per day  
- Kilometres driven  
- Meat meals per week  
- Fast fashion items purchased  
- Minutes spent showering  
- Milk type (cow, soy, oat, almond)

It then calculates estimated **water usage** and **CO‚ÇÇ emissions**, showing users where they can make simple, sustainable swaps.

## ‚ú® Features
- Interactive Tkinter GUI built in Python  
- Multi-page layout for better user experience (navigation between ‚ÄúInput‚Äù and ‚ÄúTips‚Äù pages)  
- Real-time calculation of environmental impact  
- Educational tips encouraging positive habits  
- Clear, friendly interface suitable for beginners

## üíª Technologies
Project built using:
- **Python 3.12**
- **Tkinter** for GUI design
- **Custom dictionaries** for data storage (milk types, emissions, etc.)
- **Statistical data** from environmental reports (Statista, Swissmilk, MLA, etc.)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup
To run the project locally:

Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecoimpactcalculator.git

Move into project directory
cd ecoimpactcalculator

Run the app
python main.py

## How It Works

Input collection: Users fill in fields for coffee, driving, meat meals, etc.

Calculations:

Coffee water use = coffees √ó 130 L

Driving emissions = km √ó 0.21 kg CO‚ÇÇ

Shower water = minutes √ó 9 L

Milk type uses specific per-litre data from Statista (2023) and Swissmilk (Geburt et al., 2022).

Output: Results are displayed in a readable summary box.

Tips page: Offers simple advice for reducing impact without guilt or negativity.
